#VRML V2.0 utf8

# ASimVR Polymerization CSTR Reactor Model
# This VRML file defines the 3D geometry and dynamic properties
# of a Continuous Stirred-Tank Reactor (CSTR) for polymerization.
# It is designed to be controlled and animated by Simulink via VR Sink.

# Component and Profile declarations (standard for VRML 2.0)
# These are typically uncommented in advanced VRML applications, but can remain commented
# for basic viewing if not specifically needed by the viewer/plugins.
# component USE_RigidBodies 1
# component USE_Shaders 1
# component USE_Scripting 1
# profile Interactive

# --- CRITICAL FIX: ENTIRE VRML CONTENT WRAPPED IN AN X3D TAG ---
# This wrapper is essential for web viewers to correctly interpret the scene.
# --- IMPORTANT: TOP-LEVEL 'field' DECLARATIONS AND ROUTES HAVE BEEN REMOVED ---
# Standard web VRML/X3D parsers do not support MATLAB's top-level 'field' extension.
# Allan will now directly target properties of nodes like LIQUID.translation from Simulink.
